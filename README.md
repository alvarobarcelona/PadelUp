The application uses a relational schema decoupled from Auth to allow offline players:

create table profiles (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  auth_id uuid references auth.users, -- Linked only if user registers
  username text not null unique,
  avatar_url text,
  elo integer default 1200,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);
create table matches (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  team1_p1 uuid references profiles(id) not null,
  team1_p2 uuid references profiles(id) not null,
  team2_p1 uuid references profiles(id) not null,
  team2_p2 uuid references profiles(id) not null,
  score jsonb not null, 
  winner_team smallint not null
);
